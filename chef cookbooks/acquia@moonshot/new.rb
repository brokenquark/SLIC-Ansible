Your application is configured, the following changes have been made
to your project directory:

  * Created Moonfile.rb, where you can configure your project.
  * Created moonshot/plugins, where you can place custom Ruby code
    to add hooks to core Moonshot actions (create, update, delete, etc.)
  * Created moonshot/cli_extensions, where you can place custom Ruby
    code to add your own project-specific commands to Moonshot.
  * Created moonshot/template.yml, where you can build your
    CloudFormation template.

You will also need to ensure your Amazon account is configured for
CodeDeploy by creating a role that allows deployments.
